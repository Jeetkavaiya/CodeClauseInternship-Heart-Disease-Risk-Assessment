## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using various machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to explore different models and select the one that provides the best performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease). The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of several features that include patient medical attributes and demographic information.
